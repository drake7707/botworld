## Project Description
An implementation of both neural network and genetic algorithm to evolve bots in a world

This is an implementation of a neural network and genetic algorithm to evolve bots in a world where they do specific tasks. I have defined 2 worlds for now, 1 where they forage food and avoid mines and another where they collect crystals and bring them back to their HQ.
